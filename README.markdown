# yaaws-api

**Alpha** http-client does not yet work with babashka (see Issues)

yaaws-api is _yet another_ Clojure library which provides programmatic
access to AWS services from your Clojure program. Its _raison d'être_
is to be a drop-in replacement for Cognitect's brilliant [aws-api][] that
will work from source with babashka.

yaaws-api should work with com.cognitect.aws/endpoints and
com.cognitect.aws service packages.

## deps

```clojure
{:deps {
        com.github.grzm/yaaws-api {:git/sha "adc8bab4298d00e2143fbf646299d55936914469"}
        }}
```
## In brief

Add to your `deps.edn` for Clojure or `bb.edn` for babashka:

```clojure
{:deps {com.github.grzm/yaaws-api {:git/sha "adc8bab4298d00e2143fbf646299d55936914469"}
        com.cognitect.aws/endpoints {:mvn/version "1.1.12.110"}
        com.cognitect.aws/s3 {:mvn/version "814.2.991.0"}}}
```

```clojure
(require '[com.grzm.aws.client.api :as aws])

(def sts (aws/client {:api :s3 :region "eu-central-1"}))

(def buckets (-> (aws/invoke sts {:op :ListBuckets})
                 :Buckets))

(prn buckets)
```

## Differences from aws-api

 - Uses cheshire instead of clojure.data.json when running under babashka.
 - Includes only a single http-client implementation based on java.net.http
 - Does not auto-refresh AWS credentials as the aws-api relies on
   java.util.concurrent.Executors and friends which aren't included in babashka.

## Issues
 - The aws-api needs to include a `host` header but
   java.net.http.HttpRequest considers `host` a restricted
   header. This can be overridden with the Java System property
   `jdk.httpclient.allowRestrictedHeaders=host`. This works only in
   jdk versions >= 12. This works when running on the JVM, but doesn't
   appear to work with babashka.
 - The aws-api uses for `javax.crypto.Mac` and
   `javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec` for determining
   hmac-sha-256. These classes which aren't currently included in
   babahska.  It does work with a custom babashka build that includes
   these classes. See https://github.com/babashka/babashka/pull/1066
   for a build with the classes included.
